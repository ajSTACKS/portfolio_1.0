            I've always sought out difficult tasks that are worthwhile. For me, coding is purely fun because it's very technical and you can have bugs lasting for days. You can miss a semi-colon and everything breaks, that's what keeps me coming back! Iâ€™m excited to make a big impact at a company who values creativity.
